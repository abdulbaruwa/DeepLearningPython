# Develop network model with Keras for regression problem.
# Regression: Where data is labelled with 'real' value (say floating point) rather than a label. As opposed to what we've
# used so far 'Classification'. Where a label is a assigned a class for example spam/non-spam, fraudulent/non-fraudulent.
# Examples Time Series data like stock prices over time. The decision being modelled is what value to predict for new
# unpredicted data.


# Boston house price dataset describes properties of houseds in Boston. We are concerned with modelling the prices of
# houses in thousands of dollars.
#
# 1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town.
# 2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
# 3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
# 4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
# 5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
# 6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling.
# 7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
# 8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
# 9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways.
# 10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $ 10,000.
# 11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
# 12. B: 1000(Bk âˆ’ 0.63) 2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
# 13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population.
# 14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $ 1000s.
